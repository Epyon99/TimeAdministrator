# Contribution-Guide

To maintain a high level of quality we have compiled some guidelines to help us evaluating contributions as follows:

### 1. All contributions are reviewed

No contributions are accepted into the codebase if they have not been reviewed by another appropriate contributor. Project owners decide what contributions to accept.

### 2. All contributions are tested

All functional contribution to the repository are tested, either with automated tests (Unit- and integration tests) or API-Tests. Other technologies/stacks may require different testing techniques but need to be tests non-the-less.

### 3. Documentation of functional changes

All functional changes need to be either:

* **... documented in the product documentations.** This can be an interface-specification or some general documentation in the repository - depending on what is appropriate.

* **... documented through an Issue/Bug.** If the contribution addresses issues or bugs they need to be documented in some kind of issue tracker that can link to either the PRs or Commits made for this change.

### 4. Contributions have a clean history

All contribution need a clean history:

* clean branch-lines
* rebased before merges if necessary
* merges carry the respective code review or PR in their messages
* unnecessary commits have been squashed or fixed up.
* commits have adequate sizes (mostly not too large).
